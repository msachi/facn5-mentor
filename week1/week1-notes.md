## Week 1 notes

### DOM manipulation challenge

‘Test’ in this context probably means ‘open index.html in your browser and see if it works’  
-- Need to console.log instead of return to see the result

DOM element property *innerText* returns the visible text contained in a node, while *textContent* returns the full text

updateStateValue() and updateStateValues() solutions seem to be wrong (need inputName and inputNames properties, respectively), generateUl() solution is wrong also
