# Elements of Software Design in Javascript

## Introduction
This is a resource to introduce some of the basic elements of software design to beginners. Created for the [Founders & Coders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) programme.

## Intent
The intent is for this resource:
* to become a stack-agnostic beginners guide to the elements of software design & architecture relevant to beginners and junior developers.
* to be tailored to the particular requirements of the Founders and Coders programme.
* to be structured in a modular enough way that several workshops, pitched at different experience levels, could potentially be constructed from it.

This is a work in progress. Contributions [are welcome](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Before Starting
If you intend to attempt the exercises in this repo, first clone the repo:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:foundersandcoders/ws-software-design-js.git
```
Then install the dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

## Contents
This resource is structured in _stages_, each consisting of multiple topics. It is recommended to be comfortable with the topics in one stage before moving on to another.

It is advised to spend around 15-20 minutes reading each topic within the stages, after which mentors will go through the material and ask questions to check understanding.

* [Stage 1](./stage-1)
* [Stage 2](./stage-2)
* Others coming soon...
