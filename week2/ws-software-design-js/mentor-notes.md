## Notes for mentors

### Structure of Software Design Workshop

This is a 3 hour workshop with probably more material and exercises to complete than is likely possible to. As such, mentors should let students know in advance that they probably will not complete everything and instead should focus on understanding the material.

Mentors can help students achieve this by telling them to spend around 15 minutes reading each section in Stage 1. After this mentors should spend 10 minutes talking through the material and lollipop questions (see some examples below). After this, students can either move on to the next section or on to the exercise if the section has one.

### Questions
